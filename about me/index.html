    <h2>Emily Barker</h2>
    <h3>Girly</h3>
    <p>Hello there. Its nice to meet you. My name is Emily Barker, but if you know any of my sisters you'll know they mostly call me girly. </p>
    <p>My major is Computer Science, and while I'm not sure what I would like to do with Computer Science, I enjoy coding and working with databases.</p>
    <p>Some hobbies I enjoy are watching Netflix, going out with friends, playing video games like Valorant and Minecraft with my friends, singing, organizing, and cleaning.</p>
    <p>While I currently dont have a full time job since I'm trying to focus on school work, I do create content online and while it doesnt pay much it is fun, quite simple, and I do make some money from it.</p>
    <p>This is my second semester here at BYU-I, I graduate high school in May 2021, I do have t a few places that I've really enjoyed going to. MC late nights are always a blast, going with friends to either karaoke or play giant chess. Cant forget Kiwi Loco where I weekly attend either Tuesday or Thursday for the deals. Recently I went to PizzaPieCafe and if you ever have the chance to go I highly recommend. They have great food and its a buffet.</p>
    <p>I was blessed to have been born into the church. One of my favorite quotes is from Russell M. Nelson</p>
    <p>"Be patient with yourself. Perfection comes not in this life but in the next life."</p>
