                        <h2>More Than Just Water</h2>
                        <p>Distract yourself from the stress of the day and go to the river. Best way to cool down after a long day with friends or family. Pack a lunch to relax after taking a break from the river to full up.</p>

                        <h2>Rivers</h2>
                        <p>The water that flows in rivers is fresh, meaning that it contains less than one percent salt. However, rivers still carry and distribute important salts and nutrients to support plant and animal life. For this reason, some of the most biodiverse habitats on our planet can be found around rivers. Collectively, scientists estimate that all the rivers in the world carry about 3.6 billion metric tons (four billion tons) of salt from land to the ocean each year.</p>
