                        <h2>A beautiful Moment To Share</h2>
                        <p>The waterfall was breath taking, gushing over the rocks. At its widest point, it was surging and plunging down the mountain. It had a beautiful serenity-pool at the bottom. It was veneer clear. The waterfall flowed as smoothly as syrup. The frogs croaking nearby added to the wonderful sounds. We threw ourselves under the waterfall. It was so cold that we started shuddering. We collapsed on the bank and let the nougat sweet smell of flowers wash over us. The sun peaking just over the waterfalls start was a beautiful moment to see with my family.</p>

                        <p>On our hike we had to cross over this little side bridge, hugging close to the mountain. It was a beautiful moment to see. My youngest, 7 years old, joined us for our hike and she had a blast.</p>

                            <p>Family outing on this small little hike in the forest behind this lavender feild. Our family had the most fun crossing over a bridge to reach the glorious waterfall. Fun little hike for friends or family. Our youngest, 11 years old, spent some time playing in the water and didnt want to leave.</p>

                            <p>I always loved hiking and taking my camera with me to take breath taking photos of nature. Its so peaceful and quite, unlike my daily life which can get very chaotic. The hike was no more than an hour and was just the right thing I needed.</p>
